# BSNIP PCA velocity measurement

Needs spectral_lines package available [here](https://github.com/sam-dixon/spectral_lines)

All data used to train the factor analysis model are included as text files in `BSNIPI_spectra`. `manifest.txt` is a table of the filenames and redshifts of all supernovae. `manifest_clean.txt` is identical to `manifest.txt`, but the 12 supernovae that were removed from the training sample are commented out.
